Hello!

Welcome to my [About]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }}) &#124; [Portfolio]({{ '/portfolio/' | relative_url }}) &#124; [Blog]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }})!


My name is Richard Li, and I'm interested in one thing: machine learning architecture. 
To me, this represents the intersection of applied psychology, applied philosophy, and pattern recognition-optimization. 
No wonder it's so popular! No wonder it's so powerful! No wonder it contains so much of what I want to do!

More precisely, I am very interested in ML algorithms from the statistics side, implementing end-to-end pipelines for user experience, the high-end compute that makes all this inferencing possible, and the cost functions of both the model and the user / business (they are approaching the same thing, after all!)

Have a peek at what I have been doing or any insights I have wanted to share!
